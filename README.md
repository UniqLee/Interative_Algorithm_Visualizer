# Interative_Algorithm_Visualizer

This project aims to create a dynamic visual representation of sorting algorithms in Java programming language, allowing users to see how data is processesd step-by-step.It enhances understanding of algorithm behaviour through animations and user interaction.

# Core Features:
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort(simple but slow), Merge and Sort(efficient and structured).
- Visualization: Each array is represented as a bar or square,changing dynamically a sorting progresses.
- User Controls: Buttons to select algorithms and adjust speed.
- Extendability: Can be expanded to include (A*,Dijkstra).

#  Technical Components:
- JavaFX/Swing: UI rendering and animatons.
- Timer(Timeline in JaVaFX):Controls smooth animation timing.
- Data Structures: Arrays or lists to manage sorting elements

It's valuable because it is:
- Education: Help programmers grasp sorting mechanics visually.
- Expandable: Can add more complex algorithms lke QuickSort or Heap Sort.
